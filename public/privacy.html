  <h1>Privacy Policy — {APP_NAME}</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> {EFFECTIVE_DATE}</p>

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information {APP_NAME} collects from you, how we use it, with whom we share it, how we protect it, and how you can request access or deletion. This policy also describes how to delete your account. For details on deletion see <a href="{DELETE_ACCOUNT_URL}">Account Deletion</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data:</strong> name, email, username (when you register).</li>
    <li><strong>Messages & content:</strong> prompts, conversations, and data you provide to agents (text you enter or files you upload).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> logs, timestamps, device/OS identifiers, IP address, analytics events.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment data:</strong> only if you purchase subscriptions (we do not store full card numbers; third-party payment processors handle payments).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and operate the service (chat, agents, storage of conversations).</li>
    <li>To improve and analyze the service (analytics and performance).</li>
    <li>To support customer service, billing, and fraud prevention.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third parties & SDKs</h2>
  <p>We may share data with service providers for analytics, hosting, billing, and AI processing.

You should disclose specific SDKs used (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, Stripe) here.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard safeguards (encryption in transit, limited access controls). However, no system is 100% secure — treat samples and sensitive data accordingly.</p>

  <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain account and conversation data while your account is active and for a reasonable time after you delete the account for legal and operational needs. Specific retention durations are listed here: [replace with retention rules].</p>
